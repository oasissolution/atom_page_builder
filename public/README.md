# Atom Page Builder


## How to test?

Copy "atompagebuilder" folder directly to root of your host/localhost.

Please note that; this version is a heavy development version and there may be bugs that we are aware of.

This folder is added to see where we are in development. Not to check/report bugs. 

Almost anything can be changed / added / removed.

Test / Bug report versions will be added and announced later.

From now on, we are going to update this build in every git update.


## Defaults:

### Folder: 
/var/www/html/atompagebuilder/app/

### Url in browser:
http://localhost/atompagebuilder/app/
